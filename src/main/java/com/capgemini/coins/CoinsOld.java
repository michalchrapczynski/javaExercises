 * Consider N coins aligned in a row. Each coin is showing either heads or
 * tails. The adjacency of these coins is the number of adjacent pairs of coins
 * with the same side facing up.
 * <p/>
 * It must return the maximum possible adjacency that can be obtained by
 * reversing exactly one coin (that is, one of the coins must be reversed).
 * Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins in the row. Array
 * A contains only 0s and/or 1s: 0 represents a coin with heads facing up; 1
 * represents a coin with tails facing up. For example, given array A consisting
 * of six numbers, such that:
 * <p/>
 * A[0] = 1 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 0 A[5] = 0
 * <p/>
 * the function should return 4. The initial adjacency is 2, as there are two
 * pairs of adjacent coins with the same side facing up, namely (0, 1) and (4,
 * 5). After reversing the coin represented by A[2], the adjacency equals 4, as
 * there are four pairs of adjacent coins with the same side facing up, namely:
 * (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 5), and it is not possible to obtain a higher
 * adjacency. The same adjacency can be obtained by reversing the coin
 * represented by A[3].
